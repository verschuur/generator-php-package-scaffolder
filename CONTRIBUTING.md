Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. ðŸ¤©

To contribute, please submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/verschuur/generator-php-package-scaffolder/pulls).

## Pull Requests

- **Please add tests!** - Self-explanatory.

- **Keep the documention up to date** - If you change something which needs to be documented, please do so.

- **Create feature branches** - Please don't ask me to pull from your master branch. Feature branches are fun and not scary at all!

- **One pull request per feature** - I'd rather see multiple pull requests for multiple features and/or bug fixes, than one behemoth of a pull request.

- **Proper commit history** - Make sure each commit in your pull request has a useful subject and message. If you have several _"testing..."_ or _"work in progres"_ commits, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
